I'm an _engineer-technologist_ at JSC "Peleng". I help to create modern space equipment.
Took part in the development and implementation of such technological processes as
  - heat removal from circuit board elements,
  - installation of a carrying mirror on three supports,
  - mechanical processing of carbon fiber constructions.
